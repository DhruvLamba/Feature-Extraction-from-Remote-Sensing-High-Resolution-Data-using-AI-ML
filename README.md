# Feature-Extraction-from-Remote-Sensing-High-Resolution-Data-using-AI-ML
The challenge of efficiently monitoring and managing critical infrastructure is increasingly important, particularly in the context of rapidly growing urban and rural developments. This project introduces a cutting-edge AI/ML-driven approach for the precise extraction and analysis of key infrastructure elements, including high-tension towers, windmills, electric substations, brick kilns, and farmbunds, from high-resolution remote sensing data. By employing state-of-the-art object detection models such as YOLO, the system is meticulously designed to accurately identify and classify these structures within satellite imagery. The methodology integrates advanced image segmentation and classification techniques, providing a robust tool for large-scale geospatial analysis, enabling more effective monitoring, planning, and management of critical infrastructure and land use.
